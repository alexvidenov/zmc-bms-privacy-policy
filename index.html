<h2 id="info-we-collect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p><strong>Personal information you disclose to us</strong></p>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>

<p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p>

<p><strong>Application Data.</strong> If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Geolocation Information:</strong> We may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our mobile application(s), to provide certain location-based services. You can change our access or permissions in your device's settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Device Access:</strong> We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's Bluetooth, camera, and other features.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-process">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>
<p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To save or protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="legal-bases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason to do so.</p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the legal bases we rely on. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You have given us permission for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> Where required to comply with law, cooperate with regulators, or defend our legal rights.</li>
  <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> To protect your vital interests or those of another person.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-we-share">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
  
  <li><strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs:</strong> We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g. Google Maps API, Places API). We use these APIs to retrieve information when you make location-specific requests. This includes: location data points (latitude and longitude) for user tracks, and other similar information. A full list of what we use this information for can be found in this section and in the previous section titled <a href="#how-we-process">"HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?"</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.</p>

<p>We obtain and store on your device ("cache") your location. You may revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at the end of this document.</p>

<p>The Google Maps Platform APIs that we use store and access cookies and other information on your devices. If you are a user currently in the European Economic Area (EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) or the United Kingdom, please take a look at our Cookie Notice.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>

<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

<p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>

<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="#cookie-notice">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-long">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-keep-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>

<p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<h2 id="minors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services.</p>

<p>If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.</p>

<p>If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@hiloltd.com">contact@hiloltd.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-rights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,</li>
  <li>to request rectification or erasure,</li>
  <li>to restrict the processing of your personal information,</li>
  <li>if applicable, to data portability, and</li>
  <li>not to be subject to automated decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#contact">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.</p>

<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>

<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#contact">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.</p>

<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:contact@hiloltd.com">contact@hiloltd.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dnt">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised.</p>

<p>As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

<h2 id="updates">11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
<p><em>In Short:</em> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>

<p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.</p>

<p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
